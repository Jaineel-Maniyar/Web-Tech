                <P>When the de-regulation blueprint of the Indian oil industry was announced in 1997, the world took note of the enormous potential that India offered in terms of business. From a controlled field of business to one where petrol and its products have been branded and are being positioned to attract the maximum number of consumers, the petroleum industry has come a long way.</P>

                <P>To cater to the managerial manpower requirements of the Energy and Infrastructure Sector, the Management School was first established as the Institute of Petroleum Management, Gandhinagar (IPMG) in 2006 by GERMI (Gujarat Energy Research and Management Institute), a trust and a society formed by GSPC (Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation), a Government of Gujarat undertaking. Subsequently in 2007, when Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU) was established by GERMI, IPMG became the constituent of PDEU and changed its name to School of Petroleum Management (SPM).</P>
